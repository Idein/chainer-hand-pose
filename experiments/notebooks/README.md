# notebooks

- Collection of code during development
  - We wrote jupyter notebook before writing source code for an experiment.
  - It will help us to visualize result of images, network output etc...
  - Some code contain old/regacy code, so there is no guarantee these work fine.
- It is recommend to use `jupytext` to manage notebook as `.py` format. See:
